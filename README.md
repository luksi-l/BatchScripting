# BatchScripting

## Purpouse

This is just a testing and messing with batch scripts, it's not much but i'm also converting them into executable (.exe) files to see if it's better or same (or worse)

## What to do?

Just use them, test it, tell me if there is some sort type of error and that's it!

The reason why i also placed so many files is to see if it is a good idea to use configurations, code checkers, converters and app-like placements. Otherwise people would just click on the code and run it. All of this is just a bunch of test that are being updated when i get a new idea (don't count on something big)

## Errors

Just simply report anything you find, if there is a mistake do `Pull requests` and i will check it out sooner or later. Keep in mind that i also used one of my own tools for converting witch is [![ExeMaker]](https://github.com/luksi-l/ExeMaker) that can also be used on Windows!

Just me . . .
